This extract contains a new benchmark
dataset, STSS-131, for evaluating
Short Text Semantic Similarity (STSS)
measurement algorithms. STSS-131
draws on a range of resources from
traditional grammar to cognitive
neuroscience. The human ratings are
obtained from a set of trials using new
and improved experimental methods,
with validated measures and statistics.

A. THE FULL DATASET

The first column is the number of the sentence pair. The second is the two sentences making up the pair. The
third is the semantic similarity rating calculated as the average of the human ratings for the sentence pair (0.00 –
4.00). The final column is the standard deviation of the human ratings, which gives a measure of noisiness. The
two faint entries are calibration pairs borrowed from STSS-65. These should NOT be used in calculations and
are for reference only. For a fuller understanding of how the data set was collected and the method for using it
to compare STSS measures please see A new benchmark dataset with production methodology for Short
Text Semantic Similarity algorithms, also [O'Shea, et al. 2008] & [O'Shea 2010] which you may also wish to
cite.

The following guidance is intended to help make benchmark tests performed with the data set comparable.
1. An STSS measure can be validated by comparing its performance with human ratings, in particular the ratings
that a “typical” human might give.
2. The ratings in the table follow the practice used in word similarity studies [Miller and Charles 1991]. The
“typical” human rating is the mean of those given by a set of participants. The measure of agreement is the
Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) quoted with statistical significance. The final column, S, is
the corresponding standard deviation for each mean, a measure of noisiness or lack of precision of the ratings.
3. The ratings are the numbers in the X column; they are from a rating scale running from 0.00 to 4.00. The
simplest procedure is to calculate the correlation coefficient between a new measure and the human ratings in
the original range (0.00 – 4.00). Linear transformations are permissible, e.g. dividing by 4 to re-scale them to

run from 0.00 to +1.00. Re-scaling should not lead to a different correlation co-efficient (however, see below on
rounding noise).
4. Consistency with other studies. Most STSS algorithms produce measures in the range from 0 to +1. Applying
different rounding procedures can introduce noise and lead to variations in the least significant digit of r. For
consistency with other studies, round the ratings from the STSS algorithm to 3 decimal places. Then calculate r,
and round r to 3 decimal places. Common sense dictates that as the least significant digit of the 3 is based on the
estimated digit, the importance of differences between measures based on this digit alone should not be
exaggerated.
5. Those familiar with measurement theory may argue that mean and r are unsuitable statistics for data collected
on this measurement scale. We are aware of the argument; however we have used the techniques because they
are well-established and understood in the field of word similarity. Furthermore in the data collection process
and the steps taken to improve ratio scale properties are described in detail in [O'Shea, et al. 2008] and [O'Shea
2010] as well as the current paper.
6. The calibration sentence pairs (SP99 and SP129) are taken from STSS-65 and should not be used as part of
this dataset.

B. OTHER STATISTICAL TESTS.

Various tests for significance are appropriate in different circumstances. If we want to test the
statistical significance of the difference between one STSS algorithm and another, these are
dependent samples and the appropriate test is Steiger’s z-test. This requires the construction of a
correlation triangle, described later. The one-sample t-test can be used to compare a single
correlation coefficient with an average of correlation coefficients (e.g. STASIS with the STSS-131
average from human raters). The 2-sample t-test can be used to compare averages from
independent samples (e.g. to find a significant difference between the STSS-65 and STSS-131
datasets). Finally Fisher’s r-to-z test can be used to compare correlation coefficients for the same
algorithm across two different datasets (e.g. difference between LSA on STSS-65 vs. STSS-131).
USING STEIGER’S Z-TEST TO COMPARE TWO CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS (DEPENDEDNT
SAMPLES)

Using Steiger’s test to compare 2 correlation coefficients requires the construction of a correlation triangle. For
example, consider comparing the correlation between STASIS and STSS-131 human ratings with the correlation
between LSA and STSS-131 human ratings. Correlation triangles are formed according to Figure 1 and the
specific triangle required for this calculation is shown in Figure 2.

z-values for all differences:
Method Steigers Z
0.636-0.693= -0.057; z= -0.677; p= 0.7507
(left p: 0.2493; two sided: 0.4986)
0.636-0.52= 0.116; z= 1.48; p= 0.0695
(left p: 0.9305; two sided: 0.139)
0.693-0.52= 0.173; z= 2.126; p= 0.0167
(left p: 0.9833; two sided: 0.0334)

At the time of writing, Steiger’s test was supported in neither Minitab nor SPSS. However, online calculators
were available and two different calculators were used which gave consistent results, with very small

differences attributable to operations such as rounding within floating point calculations. The calculators were
available at:
[Uitenbroek 2013] and [Grabin 2013]

Note that the test compares single correlation coefficients, not a correlation against an average of correlation
coefficients, so in this case for “Average Human” we used the human with the inter-rater agreement closest to
the average inter-rater agreement.
